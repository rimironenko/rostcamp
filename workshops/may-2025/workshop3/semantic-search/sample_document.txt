# Semantic Search Overview

Semantic search understands meaning, not just keywords. 
It uses vector embeddings to represent text.

Key benefits:
- Finds related content even with different words
- Understands synonyms and context
- Provides more relevant results

Vector databases like ChromaDB store these embeddings 
efficiently and enable fast similarity search.
