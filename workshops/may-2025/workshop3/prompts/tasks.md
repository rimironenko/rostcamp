Using that architecture, write a granular step-by-step plan to build the MVP.
Each task should:
* Be incredibly small + testable
* Have a clear start + end
* Focus on one concern
Iâ€™ll be passing this off to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to test in between.
Format this plan as an .md file.
