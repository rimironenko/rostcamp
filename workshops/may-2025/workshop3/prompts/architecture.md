Iâ€™m building a semantic search application with reranking feature.
Use Python as the programming language, ChromaDB as the vector embeddings database and OpenAI as the LLM. 
Give me the full architecture:
* File + folder structure
* What each part does
* How services connect
Format this architecture as an .md file.
